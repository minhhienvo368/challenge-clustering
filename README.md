## Comparison of classifiers


### The Mission
 - Guessing faulty bearings in the previous duty
 - The customer, the team want to know what type of failures occur. Or rather, if the failures exhibit similarities to other failures. This is a perfect clustering challenge.
#### Must-have features
 - gathering of features (5+) of your failed bearing dataset
 - kmeans clustering of at least two features of the failed bearings
 - visualization of said clustering
 - evaluation of the silhouette score of your clustering method
 - extension (one-by-one) to 6 features. (how does the silhouette score evolve?)
 - vizualizations of your model evaluation
