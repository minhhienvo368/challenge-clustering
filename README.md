 - For the experiments device shown on the picture was constructed. Two bearings were installed on the shaft. The rotation speed changed from 0 to 1500 rpm, was held for 10 seconds, and decreased to 250 rpm. 
 - The shaft was rotated using an DC motor connected to the shaft through a coupling. A radial load of 3.5 kg is applied to the shaft using a balanced weight.
The bearings were mounted on the shaft as shown in Figure 1. 
- GY-61 ADXL3353 accelerometers were mounted on the bearing housing 
- The sensor location is also shown in Figure. 
- The recording was saved along the x, y, z axes.
##### Datasets:
